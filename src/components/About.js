                    I am an inquisitive Software Developer, on a constant mission to expand my
                    knowledge. Throughout my career in the Art and Culture sector, I have developed
                    a strong analytical and critical thinking mindset. Having worked for over 10 years in
                    various roles in Customer Service, I have learnt to approach problems in a tactful,
                    open-minded, and diplomatic manner. As someone who always had an interest in
                    technologies, I am excited to start a career in a new industry, where I can build on
                    my existing skills and bring in the creativity I nourished as a freelance art critic.
